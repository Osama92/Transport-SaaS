## Optimizations for Paid Plan

Since you're on a paid plan, let's maximize quality:

### Already Implemented:
✅ **Verbose JSON** - Get confidence scores and language detection
✅ **Temperature 0** - Most accurate transcription
✅ **No artificial delays** - Fastest possible processing
✅ **Multiple retries** - Resilience for best UX

### Optional Enhancements (Available):
- **Prompt parameter** - Guide Whisper for domain-specific terms (e.g., "Dangote Cement", "Lagos")
- **Timestamp granularities** - Word-level timestamps for future features
- **Custom language hints** - Force specific language if known

**Want me to add these?** Just ask!

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: "npm: command not found"

**Solution:** Use a local terminal outside Claude Code:
```bash
cd "/home/sir_dan_carter/Desktop/Project Files/Transport-SaaS/functions"
npm run build
cd ..
firebase deploy --only functions
```

### Issue: Build succeeds but voice notes still fail

**Check OpenAI API Key:**
```bash
firebase functions:config:get openai.api_key
```

**If empty, set it:**
```bash
firebase functions:config:set openai.api_key="sk-proj-YOUR_KEY_HERE"
firebase deploy --only functions
```

### Issue: "Whisper API error (401)"

**Meaning:** Invalid or expired OpenAI API key

**Fix:**
1. Get new API key from: https://platform.openai.com/api-keys
2. Set it: `firebase functions:config:set openai.api_key="sk-proj-NEW_KEY"`
3. Redeploy: `firebase deploy --only functions`

### Issue: "Whisper API error (429)"

**Meaning:** Rate limit (unlikely with paid plan)

**Current Protection:**
- Automatic retry after 1 second
- Up to 2 retry attempts
- Exponential backoff

**If persists:** Check OpenAI dashboard for usage limits
