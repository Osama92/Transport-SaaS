# Firestore Migration Summary

This document summarizes the Firestore database integration completed for the Transport SaaS application.

## ✅ Completed Tasks

### 1. Type System Updates (`types.ts`)

**Added new interfaces**:
- `FirestoreDocument` - Base interface with `createdAt`, `updatedAt`, `createdBy`
- `Organization` - Multi-tenant organization/company structure
- `OrganizationMember` - Team member with roles and permissions

**Enhanced existing interfaces**:
- All core entities now extend `FirestoreDocument`
- Added `organizationId` field to: `Driver`, `Vehicle`, `Route`, `Client`, `Invoice`, `PayrollRun`
- Restructured `Driver`:
  - Nested `payrollInfo` object (baseSalary, pensionRate, nhfRate)
  - Nested `locationData` object (lat, lng, lastUpdated)
  - Changed `id` from `number` to `string`
- Restructured `Vehicle`:
  - Nested `telematics` object (odometer, speed, engineHours, batteryLevel)
  - Nested `locationData` object (lat, lng, lastUpdated)
  - Nested `maintenance` object (lastServiceDate, nextServiceDate)
- Enhanced `Invoice`:
  - Added `routeIds[]` for linking to routes
  - Added `subtotal`, `tax`, `total` calculations
  - Added `paidDate` field

**Backward compatibility**: Deprecated flat fields kept as optional for mock data compatibility.

### 2. Firestore Service Layer (`services/firestore/`)

**Created service files**:

#### `drivers.ts` (✅ Complete)
- `getDriversByOrganization(orgId)` - Fetch all drivers
- `getDriverById(driverId)` - Get single driver
- `createDriver(orgId, data, userId)` - Add new driver
- `updateDriver(driverId, updates)` - Update driver
- `deleteDriver(driverId)` - Remove driver
- `updateDriverLocation(driverId, lat, lng, status)` - GPS tracking
- `getDriversByStatus(orgId, status)` - Filter by status

**Features**:
- Automatic Timestamp conversion (Firestore Timestamp → ISO string)
- Nested-to-flat field mapping for backward compatibility
- Organization-scoped queries
- Real-time location updates

#### `organizations.ts` (✅ Complete)
- `getOrganizationById(orgId)` - Fetch organization
- `createOrganization(userId, data)` - Create new org
- `updateOrganization(orgId, updates)` - Update org details
- `updateOrganizationCompanyDetails(orgId, details)` - Update company info
- `updateOrganizationSubscription(orgId, subscription)` - Update billing
- `addOrganizationMember(orgId, userId, role)` - Add team member
- `removeOrganizationMember(orgId, userId)` - Remove team member

**Features**:
- Auto-creates owner as first member
- Permission validation (can't remove owner)
- Subscription status management

### 3. Custom React Hooks (`hooks/useFirestore.ts`)

**Generic hook**:
- `useFirestoreCollection<T>(collectionName, constraints)` - Real-time collection listener

**Specialized hooks**:
- `useDrivers(orgId)` - Real-time drivers
- `useVehicles(orgId)` - Real-time vehicles
- `useRoutes(orgId)` - Real-time routes
- `useClients(orgId)` - Real-time clients
- `useInvoices(orgId)` - Real-time invoices
- `usePayrollRuns(orgId)` - Real-time payroll runs
- `useNotifications(userId)` - Real-time user notifications

**Features**:
- Automatic subscription/unsubscription
- Loading and error states
- Organization-scoped queries
- Type-safe generics

### 4. Security Rules (`firestore.rules`)

**Implemented rules**:
- Organization-based access control
- Helper functions for permission checks
- User can only access their own organization's data
- Owner-only operations (create/delete org)
- Member operations (read/update within org)
- User-scoped notifications

**Key security principles**:
- All reads/writes require authentication
- Organization isolation enforced at rule level
- No cross-organization data leakage
- Subcollection access inherits parent permissions

### 5. Composite Indexes (`firestore.indexes.json`)

**Created indexes for**:
- Drivers: `organizationId` + `createdAt`
- Drivers: `organizationId` + `status` + `name`
- Vehicles: `organizationId` + `status` + `createdAt`
- Routes: `organizationId` + `status` + `createdAt`
- Routes: `organizationId` + `driverId` + `createdAt`
- Clients: `organizationId` + `status` + `name`
- Invoices: `organizationId` + `status` + `issuedDate`
- Payrolls: `organizationId` + `status` + `periodStart`
- Notifications: `userId` + `read` + `timestamp`
- Notifications: `userId` + `type` + `timestamp`
- Shipments: `userId` + `status` + `date`
- Shipments: `organizationId` + `status` + `date`

### 6. AuthContext Enhancement (`contexts/AuthContext.tsx`)

**Added exports**:
- `organizationId: string | null` - Current user's organization ID
- `organization: Organization | null` - Full organization object
- `setOrganization(org)` - Update organization data

**Enhanced functions**:
- `updateUserRole(role)` - Now creates mock organization automatically
- Session now stores: `{ user, role, organizationId, organization }`

**Mock organization creation**: When user selects role, creates:
- Unique `organizationId`
- Organization with user as owner
- Default settings (NGN currency, Africa/Lagos timezone, English)
- Trial subscription status

### 7. Documentation

**Created files**:
- `FIRESTORE_SETUP.md` - Complete setup guide with:
  - Environment configuration
  - Security rules deployment
  - Index deployment
  - Database structure explanation
  - Usage examples
  - Troubleshooting

- `FIRESTORE_MIGRATION_SUMMARY.md` - This file

**Updated files**:
- `CLAUDE.md` - Added Firestore sections:
  - Dual mode (Mock vs Firestore)
  - Service layer structure
  - Real-time hooks usage
  - Type system changes
  - Security notes

## 🎯 Database Architecture

### Multi-Tenancy Model: Organization-Based

Every partner, business, or individual gets an `Organization` document. All data is scoped to `organizationId`.

**Benefits**:
- Clean data isolation
- Easy permission management
- Scalable to thousands of tenants
- Simple backup/restore per organization

**Tradeoffs**:
- All queries must filter by `organizationId`
- Composite indexes required
- Slightly more complex migration from mock data

### Collection Structure

```
Firestore Root
├── users/                          # Auth accounts
├── organizations/                  # Tenants
├── drivers/                        # Scoped to org
├── vehicles/                       # Scoped to org
│   └── {id}/maintenanceLogs/      # Subcollection
│   └── {id}/documents/            # Subcollection
│   └── {id}/locationHistory/      # Subcollection (GPS)
├── routes/                         # Scoped to org
│   └── {id}/trackingUpdates/      # Subcollection (GPS)

├── transporters/                   # Scoped to org
└── deliveryContacts/               # Scoped to user OR org
```

### Denormalization Strategy

**What's denormalized**:
- Driver name → stored in routes (avoids join on list view)
- Driver avatar → stored in routes
- Vehicle plate → stored in routes
- Client details → stored in invoices (historical record)

**Why denormalize**:
- Firestore doesn't support joins
- Read performance is critical for dashboards
- Staleness is acceptable (driver name rarely changes)

**When to re-normalize**:
- On entity update, update all related documents
- Use Cloud Functions for consistency (future enhancement)

### Subcollections vs Arrays

**Use Arrays** (< 100 items, always read together):
- `Route.expenses[]`
- `Route.stopAddresses[]`
- `Organization.members[]`
- `Invoice.items[]`

**Use Subcollections** (growing data, paginated, queried separately):
- `vehicles/{id}/maintenanceLogs/`
- `vehicles/{id}/documents/`
- `payrolls/{id}/payslips/`
- `drivers/{id}/performanceHistory/`
- `vehicles/{id}/locationHistory/` (GPS tracking)

## 🚀 Usage Examples

### Example 1: Fetch Drivers with Real-Time Updates

```typescript
import { useDrivers } from '../hooks/useFirestore';
import { useAuth } from '../contexts/AuthContext';

function DriversScreen() {
  const { organizationId } = useAuth();
  const { data: drivers, loading, error } = useDrivers(organizationId);

  if (loading) return <Spinner />;
  if (error) return <Error message={error.message} />;

  return (
    <div>
      {drivers.map(driver => (
        <DriverCard key={driver.id} driver={driver} />
      ))}
    </div>
  );
}
```

### Example 2: Create a New Driver

```typescript
import { createDriver } from '../services/firestore/drivers';
import { useAuth } from '../contexts/AuthContext';

function AddDriverModal({ onClose }) {
  const { organizationId, currentUser } = useAuth();

  const handleSubmit = async (formData) => {
    try {
      const driverId = await createDriver(
        organizationId!,
        {
          name: formData.name,
          email: formData.email,
          phone: formData.phone,
          licenseNumber: formData.license,
          location: 'Lagos',
          status: 'Offline',
          avatar: uploadedAvatarUrl,
          payrollInfo: {
            baseSalary: 2400000, // Annual
            pensionContributionRate: 8,
            nhfContributionRate: 2.5,
          },
        },
        currentUser!.uid
      );

      console.log('Driver created:', driverId);
      onClose();
    } catch (error) {
      console.error('Failed to create driver:', error);
    }
  };

  return <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>...</form>;
}
```

### Example 3: Update Driver GPS Location

```typescript
import { updateDriverLocation } from '../services/firestore/drivers';

// Called every 30 seconds from mobile app
async function updateLocation(driverId: string) {
  const position = await getCurrentPosition();

  await updateDriverLocation(
    driverId,
    position.coords.latitude,
    position.coords.longitude,
    'On-route'
  );
}
```

## 🎓 Key Learnings

1. **Organization-based multi-tenancy is the right choice** for this application
   - Clean isolation
   - Easier to implement than row-level security
   - Scales well with composite indexes

2. **Denormalization is necessary** in NoSQL
   - Embrace it for performance
   - Use Cloud Functions to maintain consistency

3. **Subcollections are powerful** for growing datasets
   - Maintenance logs, location history, payslips
   - Don't pollute main documents

4. **Real-time listeners are expensive**
