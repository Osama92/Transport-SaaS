# Route Assignment WhatsApp Integration - Ready to Use! ‚úÖ

## Status: **FULLY INTEGRATED & READY**

Your `driver_assigned` WhatsApp template is approved and the route assignment flow is **already integrated** with automatic WhatsApp notifications.

## What Happens When You Assign a Route

When you assign a driver to a route through the dashboard, the system automatically:

1. ‚úÖ Updates route in Firestore with driver & vehicle details
2. ‚úÖ Sets driver status to "On-route"
3. ‚úÖ Sets vehicle status to "On the Move"
4. ‚úÖ Starts the route (status: "In Progress")
5. ‚úÖ Sends in-app notification
6. ‚úÖ **Sends WhatsApp notification to driver** (if phone number exists)

## Quick Start (2 Steps)

### Step 1: Add Environment Variables

Create/update `.env` file in project root:

```env
# Your WhatsApp Business API credentials from Meta
VITE_WHATSAPP_ACCESS_TOKEN=EAAxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
VITE_WHATSAPP_PHONE_NUMBER_ID=123456789012345
VITE_WHATSAPP_BUSINESS_ACCOUNT_ID=987654321098765
```

Get these from: https://business.facebook.com/wa/manage/home/

### Step 2: Restart Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

That's it! You're ready to send WhatsApp notifications.

## Testing

1. Go to **Routes** screen in dashboard
2. Click **Create New Route**
3. Fill in route details (origin, destination, etc.)
4. Click **Assign** on the pending route
5. Select a driver with a valid phone number (format: `08012345678` or `2348012345678`)
6. Select a vehicle
7. Click **Assign and Start Route**

The driver will immediately receive a WhatsApp message:

```
üìç New Route Assigned!

Route ID: RTE-xxx
Pickup: Lagos
Destination: Abuja
Scheduled Time: 2025-10-14 10:00 AM

Login to your portal to start the route.
```

## Code Implementation

### Location: `components/dashboards/PartnerDashboard.tsx`

The WhatsApp notification is sent at **lines 691-710**:

```typescript
// Send WhatsApp notification to driver if phone number exists and notifications enabled
if (driver.phone && driver.portalAccess?.whatsappNotifications !== false) {
    const route = routes.find(r => r.id === routeId);
    if (route) {
        try {
            const pickupTime = route.estimatedDepartureTime || 'TBD';
            await whatsAppNotifications.notifyDriverRouteAssigned(
                driver.phone,
                routeId,
                route.origin,
                route.destination,
                pickupTime
            );
            console.log('WhatsApp notification sent to driver:', driver.phone);
        } catch (whatsappError) {
            console.error('Failed to send WhatsApp notification:', whatsappError);
            // Don't fail the assignment if WhatsApp fails
        }
    }
}
```

### Template Used: `driver_assigned`

Template name: `driver_assigned` (APPROVED ‚úÖ)

Template parameters:
1. Route ID
2. Origin location
3. Destination location
4. Pickup time

## Driver Requirements

For a driver to receive WhatsApp notifications:

1. ‚úÖ Must have `phone` field filled in driver profile
2. ‚úÖ Phone number can be in any format:
   - Nigerian local: `08012345678`
   - International: `+2348012345678`
   - Clean international: `2348012345678`
3. ‚úÖ WhatsApp notifications not disabled (`driver.portalAccess.whatsappNotifications !== false`)

**The service automatically formats Nigerian numbers to international format.**

## Error Handling

WhatsApp notifications are **non-blocking**:

- If WhatsApp fails to send, the route assignment **still completes successfully**
- Error is logged to console but doesn't affect the user experience
- Driver can still see the route in their portal

## Monitoring

Check browser console for:

‚úÖ **Success message:**
```
WhatsApp notification sent to driver: 234801234567
```

‚ùå **Error message:**
```
Failed to send WhatsApp notification: [error details]
```

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: No WhatsApp notification sent

**Checklist:**

1. ‚úÖ Environment variables set in `.env`?
   ```bash
   # Check if variables exist
   cat .env | grep WHATSAPP
   ```

2. ‚úÖ Server restarted after adding `.env`?
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

3. ‚úÖ Driver has valid phone number?
   - Check driver details in database
   - Phone should be Nigerian format: `080...` or `234...`

4. ‚úÖ Template approved in Meta Business Manager?
   - Go to: https://business.facebook.com/wa/manage/message-templates/
   - Verify `driver_assigned` status is **APPROVED**

5. ‚úÖ Browser console showing errors?
   - Check for "WhatsApp not configured" warning
   - Check for template errors

### Issue: "WhatsApp not configured" warning

**Solution:** Add the environment variables to `.env` and restart the server.

### Issue: "Template not found" error

**Solution:** The template name in Meta must **exactly match** `driver_assigned`. Check Meta Business Manager.

### Issue: Phone number format errors

**Solution:** The service auto-formats Nigerian numbers. Just ensure the phone field has a valid number starting with `080...`, `081...`, etc.

## Rate Limits

**WhatsApp Cloud API (Meta):**
- **Free tier:** 1,000 conversations/month
- **Rate limit:** 80 messages/minute
- **Conversation window:** 24 hours

The service handles rate limiting automatically.

## Next Steps

You can send WhatsApp notifications! Just:

1. Add the 3 environment variables
2. Restart the server
3. Assign a route to a driver with a phone number

The driver will receive the WhatsApp message instantly.
