# WhatsApp Conversational AI - Natural Chat Experience

## Overview

Your WhatsApp AI now feels like chatting with a real person! It remembers context, handles errors gracefully, and responds naturally to follow-ups and retries.

## 🌟 New Conversational Features

### 1. **Conversation Memory** 🧠
The AI remembers your recent conversation (last 20 messages):
- What you asked for
- What went wrong (if there was an error)
- What action you were trying to perform

### 2. **Error Recovery & Retry** 🔄
When something goes wrong, you can simply say:
- "try again"
- "retry"
- "redo"
- "repeat"

**No need to retype everything!**

### 3. **Natural Follow-Ups** 💬
After completing an action, respond naturally:
- "yes" / "ok" / "sure" → Confirm action
- "no" / "cancel" / "stop" → Cancel action
- "1" / "2" / "3" → Quick option selection

### 4. **Out-of-Scope Handling** 🎯
The AI knows what it can and can't do:
- Friendly redirects for off-topic queries
- Helpful suggestions for business tasks
- Warm greetings and small talk responses

### 5. **Human-like Tone** 😊
- Nigerian Pidgin expressions
- Emojis and personality
- Empathetic error messages
- Conversational language

  userId: "user_123"
  organizationId: "org_456"
  currentIntent: "create_invoice"
  lastIntent: "list_clients"
  lastError: "Client not found..."
  retryCount: 2
  awaitingConfirmation: false
  awaitingInput: "retry"
  conversationHistory: [
    {
      role: "user"
      message: "List my clients"
      timestamp: "2025-10-20T14:30:00Z"
      intent: "list_clients"
    },
    {
      role: "assistant"
      message: "Sent client list"
      timestamp: "2025-10-20T14:30:05Z"

    },
    ...last 20 messages
