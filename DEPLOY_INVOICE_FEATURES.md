## Command Reference

### Type "HELP" in WhatsApp to see:

```

---

## Troubleshooting

### TypeScript Errors
```bash
cd functions
npm run build
```

**If you see errors:**
1. Check [invoiceHandlers.ts](functions/src/whatsapp/invoiceHandlers.ts) - TypeScript errors fixed
2. Run `npm install` to update dependencies
3. Try build again

### Invoice Not Creating
**Check Firebase logs:**
```bash
firebase functions:log --only whatsappWebhook --lines 50
```

**Look for:**
- ❌ "Invoice creation error" - Missing organization data
- ❌ "Client not found" - Create client first
- ✅ "Invoice created via WhatsApp" - Success!

### Template Not Showing in Dashboard
**Verify:**
1. Invoice has `template` field in Firestore
2. Dashboard component supports template rendering
3. Clear browser cache

### VAT Calculation Wrong
**Check:**
- Inclusive vs Exclusive mode
- VAT rate (default 7.5%)
- Formula:
  - Exclusive: `VAT = Subtotal × Rate / 100`
  - Inclusive: `VAT = Total × Rate / (100 + Rate)`
