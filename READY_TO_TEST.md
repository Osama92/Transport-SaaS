## 🔐 Test Mode Details

### Why Test Mode?

**Problem**: Termii SMS API blocks direct browser calls with CORS policy:
```
Access to XMLHttpRequest at 'https://api.ng.termii.com/api/sms/otp/send'
has been blocked by CORS policy
```

**Solution**: Test mode bypasses external API calls and uses a hardcoded OTP (`123456`) for testing.

### How Test Mode Works

**File**: `services/termii/termiiService.ts`

```typescript
const USE_TEST_MODE = true;  // ← Test mode enabled
const TEST_OTP = '123456';   // ← Hardcoded OTP
```

When enabled:
1. OTP sending skips Termii API call
2. Returns test OTP: `123456`
3. OTP verification checks against `123456`
4. All other features work with real Firestore data

### Disabling Test Mode (For Production)

When ready for production with real SMS:

1. **Set up Firebase Functions** (recommended):
   ```typescript
   // In services/termii/termiiService.ts
   const USE_TEST_MODE = false;

   // Deploy Termii calls to Firebase Functions
   // Functions run server-side, bypassing CORS
   ```

2. **Or set up Node.js backend**:
   ```typescript
   // Create Express/Fastify server
   // Proxy Termii API calls through backend
   ```
