## üí° Test Without WhatsApp (Temporary)

If you want to test route assignments without WhatsApp working, that's fine! The code already handles failures gracefully - route assignments will still work, you just won't send WhatsApp messages.

Console will show: `"Failed to send WhatsApp notification"` but route assignment completes normally.

## üìã Fixed Issues:

‚úÖ `whatsAppNotifications.sendText is not a function` - **FIXED**
‚úÖ Better error logging for debugging - **ADDED**
‚úÖ Template name corrected to `driver_assigned` - **FIXED**

**Next:** Just add your credentials and restart!
