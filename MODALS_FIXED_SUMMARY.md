## 🔥 How It Works Now

### Production Mode (Real Data)

```
User Action: Click "Add New Driver"
      ↓
Modal Opens: AddDriverModal
      ↓
User Fills Form: Name, Phone, Salary, etc.
      ↓
Click "Save"
      ↓
Modal calls: createDriver(organizationId, driverData, userId)
      ↓
Firestore: New driver document created
      ↓
Real-time Hook: useDrivers(organizationId) receives update via onSnapshot
      ↓
UI Updates: Driver appears in DriversTable immediately!
      ↓
Modal Closes
```

### Demo Mode (Mock Data)

```
Email === "demo@example.com"?
   YES → Use mock data from firebase/config.ts
   NO  → Use Firestore (real data)
```

## 🧪 How To Test

### Test 1: Add a Driver

1. **Login** with your account (NOT demo@example.com)
2. **Navigate** to Fleet Management → Drivers
3. **You should see an empty list** (or your previously added drivers)
4. **Click** "Add New Driver"
5. **Fill in**:
   - Name: "John Doe"
   - Phone: "+234 800 123 4567"
   - Base Salary: "150000"
   - License: "ABC123"
6. **Click "Save"**
7. **Watch the magic** 🎉
   - Button shows "Saving..."
   - Modal closes
   - **Driver appears in the list immediately!** (no refresh needed)

### Test 2: Add a Vehicle

1. **Navigate** to Fleet Management → Vehicles
2. **Click** "Add Vehicle"
3. **Fill in**:
   - Make: "Toyota"
   - Model: "Hiace"
   - Year: "2023"
   - Plate: "LAG-123-XY"

## 🎯 Real-Time Updates Across Tabs

Open your app in **two browser tabs**:

**Tab 1:**
1. Add a new driver

**Tab 2:**
2. Watch the driver appear automatically! (no refresh needed)

This works because we're using Firebase's `onSnapshot` listeners in the hooks!

## 🔐 Security

All data is:
- ✅ Scoped to your `organizationId`
- ✅ Protected by Firestore security rules
- ✅ Only visible to users in your organization
- ✅ Automatically timestamped (createdAt, updatedAt)
- ✅ Tracks who created each record (createdBy)

## 📊 Data Structure

### Driver Document:
```typescript
{
  id: "auto-generated",
  organizationId: "your-org-id",
  name: "John Doe",
  phone: "+234...",
  licenseNumber: "ABC123",
  status: "Available",
  payrollInfo: {
    baseSalary: 150000,
    pensionContributionRate: 0.08,
    nhfContributionRate: 0.025
  },
  createdAt: Timestamp,
  updatedAt: Timestamp,
  createdBy: "user-uid"
}
```

### Vehicle Document:
```typescript
{
  id: "auto-generated",
  organizationId: "your-org-id",
  make: "Toyota",
  model: "Hiace",
  year: 2023,
  plateNumber: "LAG-123-XY",
  status: "Parked",
  telematics: {
    odometer: 5000,
    currentSpeed: 0,
    batteryLevel: 100
  },
  createdAt: Timestamp,
  updatedAt: Timestamp
}
```

### Route Document:
```typescript
{
  id: "auto-generated",
  organizationId: "your-org-id",
  origin: "Lagos",
  destination: "Abuja",
  distance: 750,
  status: "Pending",
  progress: 0,
  assignedDriverId: null,
  assignedVehicleId: null,
  createdAt: Timestamp,
  updatedAt: Timestamp
}
```

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### Problem: "You must be logged in to add a driver"
**Solution**: Make sure you're signed in and have selected a role (Partner/Business/Individual)

### Problem: Data doesn't appear in the list
**Solution**:
1. Check the browser console for errors
2. Make sure you're NOT logged in as `demo@example.com` (that uses mock data)
3. Verify you have an internet connection (Firestore needs online access)

### Problem: Permission denied error
**Solution**: Deploy Firestore rules
```bash
firebase deploy --only firestore:rules
```

## 🎨 UI/UX Improvements

All modals now have:
- ✅ **Loading states** - Button shows "Saving..." while processing
- ✅ **Error handling** - Red error message displays if something goes wrong
- ✅ **Disabled buttons** - Can't click submit twice while saving
- ✅ **Form validation** - Required fields checked before submission
- ✅ **Responsive design** - Works on mobile and desktop

## 📈 What's Next?

Now that the core CRUD operations work, you can:

1. **Assign drivers to routes** - Use the AssignDriverModal
2. **Track route progress** - Update route status and progress
3. **Process payroll** - Use the CreatePayrollRunModal (uses the baseSalary you set!)
4. **Generate invoices** - Create invoices linked to completed routes
5. **Monitor fleet** - Real-time GPS tracking (already integrated!)

## 🎉 Success Metrics

Your app now has:
- ✅ **Real database** - All data persisted in Firestore
- ✅ **Real-time sync** - Changes appear instantly across all devices
- ✅ **Multi-user support** - Multiple users can collaborate simultaneously
- ✅ **Organization isolation** - Each organization's data is separate
- ✅ **Production ready** - No more mock data in production!
- ✅ **Demo mode** - `demo@example.com` still shows mock data for showcases
