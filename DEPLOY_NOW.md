---

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### **Issue: Build fails with TypeScript errors**
**Check:** All known errors have been fixed. If you see new errors, share the output.

### **Issue: Deploy succeeds but bot doesn't respond**
**Check:**
1. Verify WhatsApp webhook is pointing to the new function URL
2. Check Firebase Functions logs: `firebase functions:log`
3. Ensure OPENAI_API_KEY is set in Firebase config

### **Issue: Bot responds with "coming soon" message**
**Check:** You deployed the OLD version. Rebuild and redeploy:
```bash
cd functions
npm run build
cd ..
firebase deploy --only functions:whatsappWebhook
```

### **Issue: Acknowledgment shows but no data response**
**Possible causes:**
1. No data in Firestore (empty collections)
2. Firestore permissions blocking read
3. Check logs: `firebase functions:log`

### **Issue: "Sorry, I encountered an error" message**
**Check Firebase logs:**
```bash
firebase functions:log --only whatsappWebhook --limit 50
```

## 🎉 Next Priority Features

With 8 commands working, next to add:

1. ⏳ **View Route Details** - "show route RTE-123"
2. ⏳ **Driver Location** - "where is driver John?"
3. ⏳ **Update Route Status** - "mark route RTE-123 completed"
4. ⏳ **Transfer to Driver** - "send 50000 to John"
5. ⏳ **Overdue Invoices** - "who never pay me?"

Each takes ~20-30 minutes following the same pattern.

---

## 💰 Cost Estimate

**Current usage (100 active users):**
- WhatsApp: FREE (first 1000 conversations/month)
- OpenAI GPT-4 Mini: ~$0.15 per 100K tokens

**Expected monthly cost:** $15-25

More features = same cost (queries are cheap!)
