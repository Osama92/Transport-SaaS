# Deploy WhatsApp Fixes - Quick Start Guide

## What Was Fixed? 🔧

### 1. **Performance Issue** (2-3 minute delay → 3-8 seconds)
- Webhook now responds immediately to Meta
- Message marked as read instantly
- Function kept warm (no cold starts)
- Instant acknowledgments before database queries

### 2. **Invoice Creation Error** (Now working with full features)
- VAT calculation (7.5% Nigeria standard)
- Complete invoice structure with all required fields
- Organization and client details auto-populated
- Proper date formatting and payment details

---

## Deployment Commands

### Step 1: Build TypeScript
```bash
cd functions
npm run build
```

**Expected output:**
```
> build
> tsc

✓ TypeScript compilation successful
```

### Step 2: Deploy to Firebase
```bash
firebase deploy --only functions:whatsappWebhook
```

**Expected output:**
```
=== Deploying to 'glyde-platform'...

✔  functions: Finished running predeploy script.
i  functions: preparing codebase for deployment
✔  functions: functions folder uploaded successfully
i  functions: updating Node.js 18 function whatsappWebhook(us-central1)...
✔  functions[whatsappWebhook(us-central1)] Successful update operation.

✔  Deploy complete!
```

**Note**: First deploy with `minInstances: 1` takes 2-3 minutes to provision warm instance.

### Step 3: Verify Deployment
```bash
firebase functions:log --only whatsappWebhook --lines 20
```

## Test the Fixes

### A. Test Performance (Read Receipt Speed)

1. Send any message to your WhatsApp bot
2. Observe:
   - ✅ Message should show **single grey checkmark** immediately
   - ✅ **Double blue checkmarks** within 1-2 seconds (marked as read)
   - ✅ Bot typing indicator appears
   - ✅ Acknowledgment message within 2-3 seconds
   - ✅ Full response within 3-8 seconds

**Before**: 2-3 minutes
**After**: 3-8 seconds ⚡

### B. Test Invoice Creation

Send this test message:
```
Create invoice for Dangote Cement, 50 bags cement at 5000 naira each
```

**Expected Response:**
```
✅ Invoice Created Successfully!

📄 Invoice #: INV-202510-0001
👤 Client: Dangote Cement

💰 Amount Breakdown:
Subtotal: ₦250,000.00
VAT (7.5%): ₦18,750.00
Total: ₦268,750.00

📅 Due: Nov 19, 2025
📊 Status: Draft

The invoice has been saved to your dashboard.

What next?
1️⃣ Send to client via email
2️⃣ Create another invoice
3️⃣ View all invoices
```

### C. Verify in Dashboard

1. Log into your web app
2. Go to **Invoices** screen
3. Check latest invoice:
   - ✅ Client: "Dangote Cement"
   - ✅ Subtotal: ₦250,000.00
   - ✅ VAT (7.5%): ₦18,750.00
   - ✅ Total: ₦268,750.00
   - ✅ Status: Draft
   - ✅ Template: Classic

## Monitoring & Debugging

### Watch Live Logs
```bash
firebase functions:log --only whatsappWebhook
```

**What to look for:**

✅ **Success Pattern:**
```
INFO: WhatsApp webhook received
INFO: Message marked as read
INFO: Processing WhatsApp message
INFO: AI intent recognized: CREATE_INVOICE
INFO: Acknowledgment sent
INFO: Invoice created via WhatsApp
INFO: WhatsApp message sent
```

❌ **Error Pattern:**
```
ERROR: Invoice creation error
ERROR: Error processing message
```

### Common Issues

#### Issue: "Cold start still slow"
**Solution**: Check if `minInstances: 1` is deployed
```bash
# Verify function config
firebase functions:config:get whatsappWebhook
```

Should show:
```json
{
  "memory": "512MB",
  "timeoutSeconds": 60,
  "minInstances": 1
}
```

#### Issue: "Invoice creation fails"
**Check**:
1. Organization exists in Firestore
2. Organization has `paymentDetails` object
3. Client exists or gets created
4. User has `organizationId` in whatsappUsers collection

**Debug in Firestore Console:**
```
whatsappUsers/{phoneNumber}
  - userId: "abc123"
  - organizationId: "org_xyz"  ← Must exist!
  - email: "user@example.com"
```

#### Issue: "WhatsApp not responding at all"
**Check**:
1. Webhook URL is correct in Meta dashboard
2. WHATSAPP_TOKEN is set correctly
3. Function is deployed and running

**Verify webhook:**
```bash
curl -X GET "https://us-central1-glyde-platform.cloudfunctions.net/whatsappWebhook?hub.mode=subscribe&hub.verify_token=transport_saas_verify_2024&hub.challenge=test123"
```

Should return: `test123`

## Cost Implications

### With minInstances: 1 (Recommended)
- **Monthly cost**: ~$5 USD
- **Benefit**: No cold starts, instant responses (3-8 seconds)
- **Best for**: Production use

### Without minInstances (Alternative)
- **Monthly cost**: $0
- **Downside**: Cold starts every ~15 minutes of inactivity (2-3 minute first response)
- **Best for**: Testing/development

**To disable warm instance:**
```typescript
// In functions/src/whatsapp/webhook.ts
export const whatsappWebhook = functions
  .runWith({
    memory: '512MB',
    timeoutSeconds: 60,
    // minInstances: 1,  // Comment out this line
  })
  .https.onRequest(async (req, res) => {
```

Then redeploy:
```bash
firebase deploy --only functions:whatsappWebhook
```

---

## Rollback (If Needed)

If something goes wrong, rollback to previous version:

```bash
# List recent deployments
firebase functions:list

# Rollback to previous version
firebase functions:config:clone --from-version <previous-version>
firebase deploy --only functions:whatsappWebhook
```

---
