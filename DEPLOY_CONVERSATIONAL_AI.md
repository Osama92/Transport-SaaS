**Expected Response:**
```
Oops! Something went wrong. üòÖ

Client not found. Please add the client first or check the name.

```

```

**Expected:**

## Files Added/Modified

### New Files (1)
1. **conversationManager.ts** - 350+ lines
   - Conversation state management
   - Retry handling
   - Follow-up processing
   - Out-of-scope detection
   - Error storage

### Modified Files (3)
1. **types.ts** - Updated ConversationState
2. **messageProcessor.ts** - Integrated conversation context
3. **commandHandlers.ts** - Error recovery + history tracking

---

## Troubleshooting

### "try again" not working
**Check:**
1. Error was stored in conversation state
2. `lastError` field exists in Firestore
3. Cloud Functions logs show retry handling

**Debug:**
```bash
firebase functions:log --only whatsappWebhook --lines 50
```

Look for:
```
INFO: Error stored for retry
INFO: Retry handler triggered
```

### Follow-up numbers (1/2/3) not working
**Check:**
1. Conversation state has `lastIntent`
2. Number matches available options
3. Message is exactly "1", "2", "3", or "4"

### Greetings ignored
**Check:**
1. Message is lowercase "hi", "hello", "good morning"
2. AI confidence threshold set correctly
3. Out-of-scope handler is called

---

## Performance

### Response Times
- **Error messages**: 2-3 seconds
- **Retry prompts**: 1-2 seconds (no DB query)
- **Follow-ups**: 1-2 seconds (context lookup)
- **Greetings**: 1-2 seconds

### Database Operations
- **Per message**: +1 read (conversation state)
- **Per response**: +1 write (update state)
- **Conversation history**: Capped at 20 messages (memory efficient)

---

## Cost Impact

### Additional Firestore Operations
- **Reads**: +1 per message (conversation state lookup)
- **Writes**: +1 per response (state update)
- **Storage**: ~5KB per active conversation

### Estimate (1000 messages/day)
- Reads: 1000/day = $0.036/month
- Writes: 1000/day = $0.108/month
- Storage: 5MB = negligible

**Total**: ~$0.15/month additional cost for conversational AI

**Worth it?** YES! Much better user experience.
