// Events to listen for:
1. charge.success - When payment received
2. transfer.success - When withdrawal sent
3. transfer.failed - When withdrawal fails
4. dedicatedaccount.assign.success - When DVA created

// Example handler:
POST /api/paystack/webhook
{
  event: "charge.success",
  data: {
    account_number: "9876543210",
    amount: 1000000, // In kobo (₦10,000)
    reference: "PAY_xxxxx"
  }
}

// Action:
1. Verify webhook signature
2. Find driver by virtual account number
3. Credit wallet: creditDriverWallet(driverId, 10000, "Payment received")
4. Send SMS notification
```

## 📱 Mobile App Integration

The system is ready for mobile app integration:

```typescript
// React Native can use same services:
import { termiiService } from './services/termii/termiiService';
import { paystackWalletService } from './services/paystack/paystackWalletService';
import { getDriverTransactions } from './services/firestore/walletTransactions';

// All components are mobile-responsive!
// Just wrap with SafeAreaView
```

## 🎯 What Happens in Production?

### When Paystack Account is Verified:

1. **Virtual Accounts Go Live**
