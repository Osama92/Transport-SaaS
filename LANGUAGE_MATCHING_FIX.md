# Language Matching & Complete Client Data - FIXED ✅

## 🎯 Issues Fixed

### 1. **Language Mismatch** - FIXED ✅
**Problem:** User writes in Pidgin → Amana responds in English

**Example from screenshot:**
```
User: "i wan create invoice"  (Pidgin)
Amana: "To create an invoice, I need..."  (English) ❌
```

**Fixed behavior:**
```
User: "i wan create invoice"  (Pidgin)
Amana: "To create invoice, I need..."  (Pidgin) ✅
```

---

### 2. **Incomplete Client Data** - FIXED ✅
**Problem:** Only collecting name, email, phone (missing fields from Add Client screen)

**Missing fields:**
- ❌ Contact Person
- ❌ Tax ID (TIN)
- ❌ CAC/RC Number
- ❌ Address

**Now collects ALL fields:**
- ✅ Company Name
- ✅ Contact Person
- ✅ Email Address
- ✅ Phone Number
- ✅ Address
- ✅ Tax ID (TIN)
- ✅ CAC/RC Number

### 2. **Enhanced Client Entity Types**
**File:** `functions/src/whatsapp/types.ts` (Line 193-203)

**Before:**
```typescript
export interface ClientAdditionEntities {
  name: string;
  email?: string;
  phone?: string;
  address?: string;
}
```

**After:**
```typescript
export interface ClientAdditionEntities {
  name: string;  // Company name
  contactPerson?: string;  // Contact person
  email?: string;
  phone?: string;
  address?: string;
  taxId?: string;  // TIN

### 3. **Updated AI Entity Recognition**
**File:** `functions/src/whatsapp/aiService.ts` (Line 99)

  clientContactPerson?: string;
  clientTaxId?: string;

  // ... existing fields
}
```

**New conversation steps:**
- `client_contact` - Ask for contact person

- `client_address` - Ask for address

## 🎨 Language Detection

**How it works:**

1. **AI detects language from user's message:**
   ```typescript
   {
     "intent": "create_invoice",
     "language": "pidgin",  // Detected automatically
     "entities": {...}
   }
   ```

2. **All responses match detected language:**
   ```typescript
   getResponse('clientNotFound', 'pidgin', 'Glyde Systems')
   // Returns: "I no see 'Glyde Systems' for your client list o..."
   ```

3. **Language persists throughout conversation:**
   - User starts in Pidgin → All responses in Pidgin
   - User starts in English → All responses in English
