# Driver Wallet Test Mode

## üöÄ Current Status: TEST MODE ACTIVE

The driver wallet system is currently running in **TEST MODE** to bypass CORS restrictions and allow immediate testing of all features.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Why Test Mode?

**CORS Issue**: Termii SMS API does not allow direct browser-based API calls. When we tried to call their API from the frontend, we got:

```
Access to XMLHttpRequest at 'https://api.ng.termii.com/api/sms/otp/send'
has been blocked by CORS policy
```

**Solution**: Test mode allows you to test the complete wallet flow without needing a backend server immediately.

## üîê Test Mode Credentials

### Test OTP Code
```
123456
```

Use this code for ALL OTP verifications during testing.

### Test Driver Phone Numbers
From your Firestore database:

**John Doe**
- Phone: `07031167360`
- Alternative formats will be tried automatically:
  - `+2347031167360`
  - `2347031167360`

   - Credit John Doe's wallet with ‚Ç¶1,000
3. **Check Driver Wallet**
   - ‚úÖ Balance should update automatically
   - ‚úÖ New transaction appears in history
   - (Firestore real-time listener working)

### Phase 6: Mobile Responsiveness

Test on mobile device or narrow browser:
1. Navigate to `http://192.168.35.243:3001/driver-wallet` on mobile
2. ‚úÖ Login form responsive
3. ‚úÖ Wallet card readable
4. ‚úÖ Transaction list scrollable
5. ‚úÖ All buttons accessible

## üìä Console Logs to Watch

During testing, watch browser console for:

```javascript
// OTP Sending
‚ö†Ô∏è TERMII TEST MODE ACTIVE ‚ö†Ô∏è
üì± Phone: 2347031167360
üîê Test OTP: 123456
‚ÑπÔ∏è  For production: Deploy Termii calls to Firebase Functions to avoid CORS

// OTP Verification
‚ö†Ô∏è TERMII TEST MODE: Verifying OTP
üì± Phone: 2347031167360
üîê Entered OTP: 123456
‚úÖ Expected OTP: 123456
‚úÖ TEST MODE: OTP verification successful

// Driver Login
[LOGIN] Searching for driver with phone: {...}
[LOGIN] Try 1 - Formatted (+234...): 1 results
[LOGIN] Driver found: [driver-id]
```

## üîß How to Disable Test Mode (For Production)

When you're ready to deploy with real Termii integration:

1. **Option A: Firebase Functions Backend** (Recommended)
   ```typescript
   // In services/termii/termiiService.ts
   const USE_TEST_MODE = false; // Change to false

   // Deploy Firebase Functions to handle Termii API calls
   // Functions bypass CORS restrictions
   ```

2. **Option B: Node.js Backend**
   ```typescript
   // Create Express/Fastify backend
   // Proxy Termii API calls through backend
   // Update termiiService.ts to call your backend instead
   ```

3. **For Now**: Keep test mode enabled for complete system testing

## üéâ Ready to Test!

The system is now ready for complete end-to-end testing. Use the test OTP `123456` for all login attempts.

Access the driver wallet portal at:
```
http://192.168.35.243:3001/driver-wallet
```

Test with any driver phone number from your Firestore database. The system will automatically try multiple phone format variations.

## üìù Report Issues

If you encounter any issues during testing:

1. **Check browser console** for error messages
2. **Note the exact step** where the issue occurred
3. **Check Firestore** to verify data was saved correctly
4. **Take screenshots** if UI issues
5. **Share console logs** for debugging

---

**Note**: This test mode is specifically designed to allow comprehensive testing without backend infrastructure. For production deployment with real SMS sending, you'll need to move Termii API calls to Firebase Functions or a backend server.
