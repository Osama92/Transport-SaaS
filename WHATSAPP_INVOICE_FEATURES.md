## WhatsApp AI Recognition

The AI understands variations like:

**Template Selection:**
- "modern template"
- "use professional design"
- "minimal invoice"
- "classic style"

**VAT Options:**
- "with VAT inclusive"
- "VAT included in price"
- "add VAT on top" (exclusive)
- "5% tax rate"
- "no VAT" (0%)

**Combined:**
- "modern template with VAT inclusive"
- "professional design, 5% VAT"
- "minimal invoice, VAT already included"

---

## Integration with Dashboard

### How Templates Work
1. **WhatsApp**: Specify template when creating invoice
2. **Firestore**: Invoice saved with `template` field
3. **Dashboard**: Invoice renders using selected template
4. **PDF Generation**: Uses template styling for export

### Template Field in Firestore
```typescript
{
  invoiceNumber: "INV-202510-0001",
  template: "modern",  // classic | modern | minimal | professional
  vatRate: 7.5,
  vatInclusive: false,  // true | false
  // ... other fields
}
```

### Viewing in Dashboard
1. Go to **Invoices** screen
2. Click on any invoice
3. See it rendered with the selected template
4. Export to PDF maintains template design

---

## Troubleshooting

### "Template not recognized"
**Issue**: AI didn't understand template request
**Solution**: Use explicit keywords:
- ‚úÖ "modern template"
- ‚úÖ "professional invoice"
- ‚ùå "fancy design" (too vague)

### VAT calculation seems wrong
**Issue**: Confusion between inclusive/exclusive
**Solution**: Always specify:
- ‚úÖ "with VAT inclusive"
- ‚úÖ "VAT exclusive" or "add VAT on top"

### Preview not showing
**Issue**: Invoice number not found
**Solution**: Check invoice number:
```
list invoices  # Get correct invoice number
preview INV-202510-0001  # Use exact number
```

---
