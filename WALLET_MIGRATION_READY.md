# Wallet Balance Migration - Ready to Execute

## Status: ✅ READY

The migration button has been successfully integrated into your Partner Dashboard.

## What Was Fixed

### 1. **Driver Creation** (`services/firestore/drivers.ts:124`)
- New drivers now automatically get `walletBalance: 0` when created
- This prevents the issue for any future drivers

### 2. **Migration Function** (`services/firestore/drivers.ts:385-423`)
- Created `migrateDriversAddWalletBalance()` function
- Safely adds `walletBalance: 0` to all existing drivers that don't have it
- Idempotent (can run multiple times safely)
- Includes detailed console logging

### 3. **Migration UI** (`components/MigrationButton.tsx`)
- Yellow warning banner on Partner Dashboard
- One-click migration execution
- Confirmation dialog before running
- Shows success/error status

### 4. **Dashboard Integration** (`components/dashboards/PartnerDashboard.tsx:297`)
- Migration button appears between stat cards and main content
- Only shows for users with an organizationId

## How to Run Migration

1. **Open the app**: http://localhost:3006
2. **Login as Partner** user
3. **Look for yellow banner** at the top of the dashboard (below stats)
4. **Click "Run Migration"** button
5. **Confirm** when prompted
6. **Check console** for detailed migration logs

## Expected Results

### Console Output:
```
[MIGRATION] Starting wallet balance migration for organization: dhayo213@gmail.com
[MIGRATION] Added walletBalance to driver: DRV-20251010-214310-nvf2sj
[MIGRATION] Migration complete!
[MIGRATION] Migrated: 1 drivers
[MIGRATION] Skipped (already had walletBalance): 0 drivers
```

### UI Feedback:
- Button will show "Migrating..." while running
- Success message: "✅ Migration successful! Check console for details."
- Error message: "❌ Migration failed: [error details]"

### Driver Portal:
- John Doe's wallet balance should now display **₦0** instead of undefined
- Debug logs will show: `Wallet balance from Firestore: 0`

## Next Steps After Migration

1. **Verify wallet balance displays correctly** in driver portal
2. **Create a payroll run** (Payroll screen → Create Payroll Run)
3. **Process payroll** for the period containing driver work
4. **Mark payroll as "Paid"** to:
   - Credit driver wallets (walletBalance will increase)
   - Generate payslips (visible in driver portal)

## Remove Migration Button (Later)

Once all drivers are migrated and verified, you can remove the migration button by:

1. **Remove import** from `PartnerDashboard.tsx:27`:
   ```typescript
   import MigrationButton from '../MigrationButton';
   ```

2. **Remove button component** from `PartnerDashboard.tsx:297`:
   ```typescript
   {organizationId && <MigrationButton organizationId={organizationId} />}
   ```

3. **Delete file**: `components/MigrationButton.tsx`

## Troubleshooting

### If migration button doesn't appear:
- Check that you're logged in as a Partner user
- Verify `organizationId` exists in your user session
- Check browser console for errors

### If migration fails:
- Check browser console for detailed error message
- Verify Firebase/Firestore connection is working
- Check that user has write permissions to Firestore

### If wallet balance still shows undefined after migration:
- Hard refresh browser (Ctrl+Shift+R or Cmd+Shift+R)
- Check Firestore console to verify `walletBalance` field was added
- Check that driver document ID matches (e.g., DRV-20251010-214310-nvf2sj)
