## üöÄ Method 1: Local Network Testing (Fastest - 5 minutes)

Test on your phone/tablet using the same WiFi network.

### Steps:

1. **Start the mobile dev server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev:mobile
   ```

2. **Find your computer's IP address:**

   **Windows (Command Prompt):**
   ```bash
   ipconfig
   ```
   Look for `IPv4 Address` under your active network adapter (e.g., `192.168.1.100`)

   **Mac/Linux (Terminal):**
   ```bash
   ifconfig | grep "inet "
   ```
   Or check System Preferences ‚Üí Network

3. **Connect your mobile device:**
   - Make sure your phone/tablet is on the **same WiFi network** as your computer
   - Open any browser on your mobile device
   - Navigate to: `http://YOUR_IP_ADDRESS:3003`
   - Example: `http://192.168.1.100:3003`

4. **Test both portals:**
   - **Admin Portal:** `http://YOUR_IP:3003`
   - **Driver Portal:** `http://YOUR_IP:3003/driver-portal`

### ‚úÖ Pros:
- Instant setup
- Hot reload works on mobile
- Free
- Test multiple devices simultaneously

### ‚ùå Limitations:
- Only works on same WiFi network

# Access from phone: http://YOUR_IP:3003
```

### **Phase 2: Share with Testers (This Week)**
```bash
# Use ngrok for remote testing
npm run dev        # Terminal 1
ngrok http 3003   # Terminal 2
# Share ngrok URL with drivers/partners
```

### **Phase 3: Beta Testing (Next Week)**
```bash
# Deploy to Vercel for persistent staging
vercel
# Share Vercel URL for beta testing
```

### **Phase 4: Production (When Ready)**
